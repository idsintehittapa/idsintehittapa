I’m gathering data about common curse/swear/profanity words and phrases for my next data visualization. The point is to test a hypothesis that I have and also start gathering a profanity dictionary ^^ (because why not!).

So far, I have gathered data from roughly 15 countries. Evidently, I need help.

##### This is what I am looking for
I am interested in the words' literal meaning. Like, if you say "balls" and it's used as "darn", you still use balls as the curse/swear/profanity word.

##### This is what I would love help with
I need you to send me a list of top 15 (or as many/few you can figure out) profanity words in your native language. It _has_ to be words/phrases that are commonly used and you need to translate them for me. I am, sadly, only fluent in Swedish and English.

Some examples of what I am looking for:

PORTUGESE
- Cabra / Cabrão – “Bastard” or “Fucker”
- Monte de Merda – “Piece of Shit”
- Caralho – “Dick”
- Vai Para o Caralho – “Go Fuck Yourself”
- Rego Do Cu – “Ass Crack”
- Puta Que Pariu – “Holy Shit”
- Chupa-mos – “Suck it”

SWEDISH
- Jävlar - "sod it"
- Fitta - "cunt"
- Kuk - "cock"
- Fan - "the devil"

Please send me your top 15 profanity words/phrases! I really want to try out my hypothesis. 

Thanks a lot!
