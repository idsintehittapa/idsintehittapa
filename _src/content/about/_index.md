title: "About me"
---

My name is Johanna Blom, I am based in Sweden, and I like data as a concept (i.e. what data can(not) tell me about certain topics). My background is in sociology so the data that interest me is mostly related to society. To help me analyze data in faster and more productive ways I’ve come to the conclusion that I need to learn how to program – hence, I am learning Python and some R. To make my programming journey more fun, I started gather interesting/weird open data online from blog posts, articles, forums etc. to practice how to tidy, manipulate and finally visualize my results. Looking back, I wish I would have known how creative and extremely fun it is to program!

Professionally, I want to combine my sociological and programming skills. I am looking and open for challenges and new opportunities. Drop me an email or contact me in another suitable way if you think we could work together!
