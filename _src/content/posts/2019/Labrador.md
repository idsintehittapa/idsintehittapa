A few week back the theme of [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk) was top 10 chocolate bars. When scouting how to represent this the best I found someone who had made a bump chart over America’s kennel club most popular breeds - since I am a dog person I got curious: how does it look in Sweden?.

Turns out: **we all love the Labrador**, but in Sweden we apparently also love hunting! (yes dog people, don’t be alarmed - I know the Labrador is part of hunting too, but they fetch). **The largest fall from popularity** is the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, starting at rank 8 and rank 16 in 2018 - hm?!
**For me, the most unexpected popularity journey** is made by the Bichon Havanais (it’s a small fluffy dog)

It also saddens me that the breeds  with short noses still are so popular here, I hope a change in breeding will make Pugs, French bulldogs and other similar dogs able to breed. 

###### Workflow for the visualization

- I searched SKK for their yearly dog breed popularity data
- gathered it, cleaned it and grouped it :)
- then visualization time!

Ps. [My dog](https://www.skk.se/sv/kopahund/hundraser-valpkullar/australian-kelpie/) isn’t even on the list! How is that possible??
