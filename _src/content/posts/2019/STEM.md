Analyzing gender within STEM subjects has increased a lot.. Or at least people talk a looot about it! 
<!--more-->

![STEM][1]

It made me curious on what has actually happen - what are the trends and how frequent are gender keywords in these studies for real?

I narrowed it down to check the two largest Engineering education journals I know (European Journal of Engineering Education and Journal of Engineering Education). 

My search on these pages was: 
- Your search for [All: gender]
- This gave 712 hits in total. However, **it turns out that around only 100 articles had any keywords related to gender**. Bummer..
- To get some more data I added Engineering Studies which added around 60 hits and 20 articles having any related gender keywords. 


#### I give you: 15 years of gender research within Engineering Education where the most frequent word (both over the year and counts) is GENDER.


It is interesting to see that underrepresentation and diversity are topics that have interested researchers during these 15 years. And also, that  feminist research, masculinity, intersectionality, trans and LGB have been examined since 2011.
