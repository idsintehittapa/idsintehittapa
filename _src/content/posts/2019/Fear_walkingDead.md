Since [Fear the walking dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3743822/) is more about sociology issues  than zombies I find it interesting.

![ftwd][1]

I got curious who has, so far, survived the undead apocalypse most successful… turn out **drum-role** it is the cast read as women (I am leaving it unsaid if this is due to lack of diversity within the show or simply since the female characters follow reality and take less risk and, therefore, don’t die in stupid accidents ;)).

#### Fear the walking dead men!

Btw, it seems like the **leading cause of death** is caused by humans and not walkers.. I’ll do another visualization of this!
