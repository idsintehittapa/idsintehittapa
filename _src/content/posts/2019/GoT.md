So, I made a social network over who, directly or indirectly, kills who in GoT.. 
<!--more-->

![ftwd][1]

Well, I made it only for the main female characters.. since you know, more fun and interesting. Turns out they killed some relevant people for the story! (maybe I should make one for the male characters too, for analyzing story impact?)

And no, obviously genocide doesn’t count (can’t find images representing all those people!)


###### About Gephi
I tried to make this using python first, but that did not turn out as I wanted. Therefore, I tried Gephi. I could easly connect nodes and calculate weights, etc. It was also kind of easy to add the images and colors. However, preview mode did not work very well and to see changes I had to download the file. But, if you are into social networks - do try Gephi! :)
