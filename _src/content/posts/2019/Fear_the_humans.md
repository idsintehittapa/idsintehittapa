As promised, a visualization of human vs walkers’ killing count in Fear the walking dead. 
<!--more-->

![ftwd][1]

The walkers start of kind of strong with almost 10 kills compare to the humans’ lame 5. But then they fall behind. So here you have it, **the leading cause of death** is due to humans within Fear the walking dead. 

The data held 111 deaths, 4 cause of death was missing - In total 107 deaths are visualized. 

All in all, men beware of other men (dead or alive) if there ever is an undead apocalypse.
