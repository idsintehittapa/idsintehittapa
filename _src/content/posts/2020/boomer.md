A weird outcome of covid-19 is related to an increased interest in pet ownership. But, before taking on the responsibility of a living being, do think twice. 

### Are you getting a dog because...

#### they are cute, you say?
Well, they ARE cute - but they also bite, and bite, and bite AND, did I mention that they bite? 

#### picturing yourself and the dog chilling in the evening, are you?

Alas, puppies hate sleeping in the evening - or they prepare themselves for sleeping through the night by totally demolishing your home for quite some time before they, in the middle of a jump, fall asleep. 

#### they are smart, you think?

Puppies are not smart and they do stupid things all the time, like suicidal jumps from the sofa and the run to fast to be able to break into a wall.

#### But, here he is! The cute, biting, and not so smart puppy - Hey Boomer!
